## PING PONG ELO SYSTEM - BACKEND

This is a web service that manages the Ping Pong ELO of players at the J.B. Hunt summer internship. 

Follows a similar rating system to chess elo. The ranks and the way the system works for a new player is inspired by Codeforces. See the articles below for more information:
- [Elo Rating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)
- [Rating System for new players](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77890)

The rating system right now is very basic and needs improvement. If you have suggestions for these sorts of changes please message me (Nicholas Robinson) on teams. If there are any other improvements you want to make (someone write tests please I don't want to) or bugs you want to fix, feel free to submit a PR.
